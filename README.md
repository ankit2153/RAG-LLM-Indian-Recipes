# RAG-LLM Indian Recipes

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that provides Indian food recipes using a local LLaMA model. This application leverages Streamlit for the user interface, ChromaDB for storing embeddings, and Ollama for the Qwen2: 1.5B model. Users can interact with the app to ask about various Indian recipes from the "Garden to Kitchen: Nutrient Rich Recipes from Home Garden Produce" PDF.

## Features

- **Streamlit Integration:** A user-friendly interface to interact with the application.
- **ChromaDB:** Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **Local LLaMA Model (Qwen2: 1.5B):** Provides accurate and context-aware responses to recipe queries.
- **Conversational Interface:** Users can talk and ask about different Indian recipes.
- **Book pdf** -- https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rekha-Sinha-2/publication/371234244_Garden_to_kitchen_Nutrient_rich_recipes_from_home_garden_produce/links/6479e4a3d702370600cc458b/Garden-to-kitchen-Nutrient-rich-recipes-from-home-garden-produce.pdf


## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the Streamlit interface. Type your queries about Indian recipes, and the application will retrieve relevant information from the PDF and provide detailed responses using the LLaMA model.
